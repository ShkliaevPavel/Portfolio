  <h1> Let me show you something...</h1>

Here you can find my study projects:
  + [Python](https://github.com/ShkliaevPavel/Portfolio/tree/Python)
  + [SQL](https://github.com/ShkliaevPavel/Portfolio/tree/SQL)

When I worked as a clinical research associate I was never satisfied how project information being stored.<br/>
To make it more transparent for all placeholders I started creating PowerBI reports.<br/>
I gathered main information about projects and it looks much better and user-friendly.<br/>
I'm still working on it...<br/>

Some examples:
1. What's the name of that project where...There is so much colleagues...
   + You don't have to remember all 
   + Key information and stakeholders in one place

2. Enrollment status: a very significant information for a project team!
    + Now you can see detailed info: Screened / Enrolled / Target etc
    + For each country / region and global status
    + Quick analysis to be sure your project is in timelines (or not...)

3. Go deeper and find out where you have better results and where some issues need to be fixed
   + You always have plan vs fact
   + Trendline shows where you will be

Couple months ago my ex-colleague asked me to help with her psycology start-up.<br/>
